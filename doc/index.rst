Production Line Sequence Module
###############################

The production_line_sequence module adds a sequence field in BOM inputs/outputs
and production input/outputs. The sequence field is copied from BOM to
production when a BOM is exploded inside a production.

The list views of BOM inputs/outputs are editable lists to edit the BOM lines
quickly.
